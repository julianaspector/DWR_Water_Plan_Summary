# Summarizing DWR Water Plan Updates 2013 and 2018

Data was provided by DWR in one workbook with sheets for each year of water use organized by planning areas. Planning areas were aggregated into appropriate regions, summed, and then averaged over years of interest. Averaged years of interest were 2005-2010 (based on 2013 update), 2005-2010 (based on 2018 update), and 2005-2015 (based on 2018 update). 

Water supply data throughout the state was analyzed to determine average Sacramento River/Delta supplies entering and leaving different hydrologic regions for 1998-2015 and 2005-2015. Calculations were based on DWR's regional inflows and outflows conceptual diagram.
