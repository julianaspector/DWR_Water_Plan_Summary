#Summarizing DWR Water Plan Updates 2013 and 2018

Data was provided by DWR in one workbook with sheets for each year of water use organized by planning areas. Planning areas were aggregated into appropriate regions, summed, and then averaged over years of interest. Averaged years of interest were 2005-2010 (based on 2013 update), 2005-2010 (based on 2018 update), and 2005-2015 (based on 2018 update).
